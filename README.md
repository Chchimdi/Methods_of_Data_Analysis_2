# Advanced Statistics

## Overview
Welcome to my repository containing a collection of assignments from an advanced statistics class, in which I achieved an A grade.
This class delved into the intricacies of multiple linear regression and related techniques, equipping me with robust analytical skills and a deeper understanding of statistical modeling.

## Course Content
The class covered a comprehensive array of topics central to multiple linear regression and its applications, including:
- Multiple Linear Regression: Introduction to regression models involving multiple predictors and the interpretation of regression coefficients.
- Model Checking: Techniques for diagnosing the fit of a regression model, including residual analysis and assumptions testing.
- Dummy Variables: Use of dummy (indicator) variables for incorporating categorical predictors into regression models.
- Regression in ANOVA Models: Application of regression analysis for analyzing variance, particularly useful for complex experimental designs.
- Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA): Combining ANOVA and regression to adjust for the effect of a continuous covariate, enhancing the analysis of experimental data.
- Variable Selection Methods: Exploration of various techniques for selecting the most significant predictors in a regression model, such as forward selection, backward elimination, and stepwise regression.

## Achievements
Through this coursework, I have:
- Mastered the theory and application of multiple linear regression, including the interpretation of complex models.
- Developed practical skills in model diagnostics and validation, ensuring the robustness and reliability of statistical analyses.
- Learned to handle categorical data within regression models through the effective use of dummy variables.
- Gained experience in integrating regression techniques with ANOVA and ANCOVA for more sophisticated analyses of experimental data.
- Acquired proficiency in variable selection methods, enhancing model simplicity and interpretability.
